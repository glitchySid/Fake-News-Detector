# Fake News Detection Using TensorFlow and NLP
Project Description
This GitHub project aims to create a robust and accurate fake news detection system that classifies news headlines as either real or fake. Utilizing the power of TensorFlow and advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project analyzes the intent and language in news headlines to discern their authenticity.

Features
Deep Learning with TensorFlow: Leverages TensorFlow for building and training neural network models that can accurately classify news headlines.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Employs state-of-the-art NLP techniques to understand the context, sentiment, and intent behind news headlines.
Data Preprocessing: Includes comprehensive data preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and removal of stop words to prepare the text data for model training.
Feature Extraction: Utilizes techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings, and more to convert text data into meaningful numerical representations.
Model Training and Evaluation: Provides scripts for training various machine learning models and evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
User-Friendly Interface: Includes a simple interface for users to input news headlines and receive real-time predictions on their authenticity.
